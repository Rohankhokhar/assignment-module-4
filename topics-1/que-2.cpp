oop :-
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. The data is stored in fields (also known as attributes or properties), and the code is stored in methods (also known as functions or procedures). OOP is designed to improve software modularity and reusability by organizing software design around objects rather than functions or logic.

Here are the key concepts of OOP:

1)Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.

2)Object: An instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on the data. In OOP, everything is considered an object.

3)Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

4)Abstraction: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

5)Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class (called a subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and methods from another class (called a superclass or base class). It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

6)Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same interface. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and run-time (method overriding).

syntax of class:
class ClassName{
    // visibility :
    // data member [attribute and property]
    // member function [method and function]
}

ClassName obj_name; // syntax of object
