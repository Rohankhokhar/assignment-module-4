//What is the difference between OOP and POP? :-
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) are two different programming paradigms that have distinct approaches to software design and development. Here are the key differences between OOP and POP:

1. Basic Concept :-
OOP: Centers around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. These objects encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to model real-world entities.
POP: Focuses on the sequence of tasks or procedures to be performed. It structures the program as a series of functions or procedures.

2. Data and Functions :-
OOP: Data and functions are bundled together in objects. Data is accessed and manipulated through methods, maintaining encapsulation.
POP: Data and functions are separate. Functions operate on data, which is often passed around in the form of arguments.

3. Modularity and Reusability :-
OOP: Encourages modularity through classes and objects. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation facilitate code reuse and flexibility.
POP: Modularity is achieved by organizing the program into functions. However, reusability is often limited compared to OOP because of the lack of support for inheritance and polymorphism.

4. Data Security:-
OOP: Data is encapsulated within objects, providing a mechanism for data protection. Access to data can be controlled using access modifiers (public, private, protected).
POP: Data is usually global and accessible by any function, which can lead to security issues and unintentional data modification.

5. Approach to Problem Solving :-
OOP: Focuses on modeling entities and their interactions. The design revolves around identifying the objects and their relationships.
POP: Focuses on breaking down the problem into a series of steps or functions. The design revolves around the sequence of actions to be performed.

6. Scalability and Maintenance :-
OOP: More scalable and easier to maintain because of its modular nature. It is easier to update and manage large codebases.
POP: Less scalable and more difficult to maintain, especially for large projects. Changes in data structures or procedures can require extensive modifications.

7. Examples of Languages :-
OOP: Languages like Java, C++, Python (supports both OOP and POP), and C#.
POP: Languages like C, Pascal, and early versions of BASIC.
